# BiasAssessment

Run the Plot.py script to produce three plots present in the preprint 'Satellite solar radiation for intra-hour and intra-day applications: Biases and uncertainties by season and altitude' (Carpentieri et al., 2022).
In the SatBiasMetrics folder the csv files containing all the metrics for all the SMN, SACRaM and BSRN stations analyzed in the paper https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038092X23001810. Each file's name comprehends the satellite-derived product they compute the metric of, plus indication on the various filtering method presented (Daytime/Night+Daytime/Peak).
